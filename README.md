Hello guys this is UCBDev,
I will show you how to implement Elasticsearch, how to create model indices, how to make crud operations with them. I will especially add different kind of custom search queries. We will also use Kibana to manage Elasticsearch.
Also we are gonna use Serilog sink to reflect our API log context into the Elasticsearch so we will be able to store our logs.
